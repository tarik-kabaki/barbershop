Hello IShak / dev Team

I hope you are all doing well, I want to give notes about the project, first before I started the project I gathered a lot of stuff like images and libraries that were needed for the task before I started coding so that 1 hour would be enough.

I have some features about this task that I didn't have enough time to implement like :

1. disable old dates on the calendar.
2. disable old Times in the second section.
3. implement validation for inputs like full name | email | phone ...
4. making API POST requests
5. inserting the appointments in the backend

   and a lot more stuff for the tasks 

   Best regards
   Tarik Kabaki
